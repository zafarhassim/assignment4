This assignment utilizes hashmaps. It takes a csv file containing movies, their genre and release year. Initially, my intention was to use the find(get) function to parse out the year to find the occurrence for each genre. However, I couldnâ€™t get hashmap to display the linked list for each genre. So, instead I used multiple arrays to count this.
